* Building a Modern Computer from First Principles
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The cognitive ability to “divide and conquer” a complex system into manageable modules is empowered by yet another cognitive gift: our ability to discern between the abstraction and the implementation of each module. In computer science, we take these words concretely: abstraction describes what the module does, and implementation describes how it does it. With this distinction in mind, here is the most important rule in system engineering: when using a module as a building block—any module—you are to focus exclusively on the module’s abstraction, ignoring completely its implementation details.
